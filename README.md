# WhatsApp Message Bot
Very simple python script to do certain tasks interactively by reading messages sent by user. 

# Information
Script opens an Google Chrome instance, load web.whatsapp.com, capture QR code using selenium, show qr code to user and wait for user to scan it. After qr is scanned, script will detect it and ask user contact to send a "start" message from another phone/client. After receiving "start" message, script will start to read messages sent by user and do certain tasks.

# Requirements
- Linux or Windows running machine (hasn't been tested on other OSs).
- Beginner level knowledge on how to use a computer, to be able to read and understand basic English.
- A little bit of patience, because i suck at programming and probably you will face some issues which obviously contradict previous statement. w
